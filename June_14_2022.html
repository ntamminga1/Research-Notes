    <h3>Keeping tabs on what I've done the past 3 weeks:</h3>
    <p>I met with Scott last week and discussed the experimental set up of our laser system. I have a pretty good understanding of what we are trying to 
      do. Scott suggested that I learn more about computer networks since that seems to be the area where I am lacking the most understanding. 
      <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-network">This website</a> is a good resource I found.</p>
    <p>I also attended the HEDP Summer School put on my University of Michigan. It was useful, but I would like to study more. The text they recommend 
      is <i>High-Energy-Density Physics</i> by R. P. Drake. I picked it up from the library to tackle once I finish Chen.</p>

    <p>We want to run through and control the main laser energy, pre-pulse energy, and the target z-position. The outputs we will measure are the proton 
      and electron energy spectrum. In the group meeting yesterday, target thickness was also discussed as well as removing the pre-pulse control since 
      our laser has such good control over the pre-pulse.</p>
    <ul>Work for this week:
      <li>Get the last of the materials (Emailed Jenny about their arrival)</li>
      <li>Finish Chen</li>
      <li>Meet with Scott to discuss next steps</li>
    </ul>
