    <p>I watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjegqWUxVhc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESY LAP talk</a>.</p>
    <p>Here are some notes/questions I had while watching</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mainly focuses on data driven optimization of beam parameters</li>
      <li>What is Bayesian optimization/statistics?</li>
      <li>They run a Python layer overtop of the DOOCS control system</li>
      <li>Have a closed feedback loop that adjusts the energy input to the plasma source by changing the polarization</li>
      <li>They also have a wavefront sensor and motorized beam expander in closed loop to change the beamfront</li>
      <li>They use a gas target combination of N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. The N<sub>2</sub> creates a downhill gradient into the acceleration region</li>
      <li>Their optimization tends to focus on N<sub>2</sub> concentration, gas density, focus position, and laser energy</li>
      <li>Read more on Bayesian optimization</li>
      <li>His system optimizes over 50 iterations at ~1Hz repetition rate, what happens when we have a ~kHz rep rate? How quickly can we analyse and adjust a high rep rate system?</li>
      <li>Trained an artificial NN on 5000(80:20) set to test robustness of system? I am not entirely sure what they did here</li>
      <li>Electron beam stabilization related to laser stabilization</li>
      <li>Next step: Active stabilization at high rep rate (kHz)</li>
      <li>Building KALDERA laser lab which will be a 3J in 30fs at 1kHz rep rate</li>
    </ul>
