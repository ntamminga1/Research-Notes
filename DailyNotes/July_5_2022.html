    <h1>Week of July 5, 2022</h1>
    
    <h3>Tuesday, July 5</h3>
    <p>Went to to WPAFB today and got the Nucleo boards set up. First, I soldered together the BNC cables to male bread board wires. Then I flashed new 
    firmware to the boards. One was connected to the main pulse photodiode and the other is connected in the chamber. Both are pinging and working good. 
    The chamber IP is 196.254.31.200 and the main pulse photodiode's IP is 196.254.31.201. My laptop has been switched to 196.254.31.199. Lastly, I got a 
    LabView file from Scott which output the signal from the photodiode. We saw 14-15 peaks (or laser pulses) on our graph. They peaked at 150 mV and 
    dropped back down to ~70mV. Also, when there was no trigger, the baseline was ~70mV. Scott said his math is off and he'll fix it.</p>
