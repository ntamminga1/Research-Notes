    <h3>Thursday, August 24</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Finished data analysis from 8-3 and 8-16</li>
      <li>From the 8-3 data, it did not look good at all. There was very little correlation in both pulses on specific shots, the data 
        looks like utter garbage.</li>
      <li>The 8-16 data is a lot better. You can see significant features carry over between both the prepulse and the main pulse. Also,
        the timing was good and the shot numbers correlated wonderfully</li>
      <li>One note: the small fluctuations seem random between the prepulse and main pulse. So, the fluctuations are either in the 
        specific lines, or they are coming from the diodes/data collection system</li>
    </ul>
