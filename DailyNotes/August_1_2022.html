    <h3>Monday, August 1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Worked out last of timing issues with BBB</li>
      <li>Set up pre pulse diode</li>
      <li>Took data set of main pulse and pre pulse diodes, 
      main pulse yvals looked like a good trace (decimate 1) prepulse looked bad. (See Jupyter notebook)</li>
      <li>Took data set of main pulse and pre pulse diodes, main pulse yvals looked like a good trace (decimate 1) 
      prepulse looked bad. (See Jupyter notebook)</li>
      <li>Worked on labview energy reading</li>
      <li>Joe worked on p/e spec alignment</li>
      <li>Rosie is a firmware that throws out triggers, to match with what the p/e spec can handle (use decimate 20, for 50Hz)</li>
      <li>Computer times are all synced now</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Tuesday, August 2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Put CCD camera computers in mental junction boxes</li>
      <li>Decimate at 50 to start</li>
      <li>Took lots of data, target needs work, about 6.6 million shots recorded and triggers still in sync</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Wednesday, August 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Took lots of data, target needs work, about 6.6 million shots recorded and triggers still in sync</li>
      <li>Worked on metal junction boxes and installing the CCD’s into other spec</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Thursday, August 4</h3>
    <p>Finished HDF5 quick analysis python script, saved to desktop</p>
    
    <h3>Friday, August 5</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Switched the p-spec to 5P08, worked on installing VIPM to it, but this computer has LabView 2014, not 2020. 
        I need to get the 2014 compatible version of VIPM and then install the given packages (3x openg packages and LiveH5 package). 
        These should be found in the shared drive</li>
      <li>Bad target again today, Joe tried to find electrons but couldn’t get the target to cooperate.</li>
      <li>Kyle will think about Hamamatsu placement in chamber</li>
      <li>Nucleo connected to MighTex got it’s trigger 150 microseconds earlier to allow the MighTex to have more lead time</li>
      <li>Edited the H5 Analysis script to allow for immediate shot comparison</li>
    </ul>
