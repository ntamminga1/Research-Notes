    <h1>Deuteron Mean Free Path Calculation</h1>
    
    <p>
      Most of the math used in this calculation can be found either from 
      <a href="https://ntamminga1.github.io/Research-Notes/May_13_2022.html">my meeting with Chris</a> or from 
      <a href="https://ntamminga1.github.io/Research-Notes/May_18_2022.html">the Davis and Petrov article</a>. 
      The first step to calculating the MFP will be to find the stopping power. From the Davis and Petrov article, I know that
      $$ S_{D-X}(E) = S_{H-X}(\frac{E}{2}) $$ Here X will need to be O and D, because we are dealing with a D&#8322;O vapor.
      Since the PSTAR calculates proton stopping power, which is basically a Hydrogen atom. I will use this in a material 
      of both Hydrogen (to estimate the \( S_{D-D} \) stopping power), and Oxygen. If we want deuterons of 2.5MeV, then we want
      to find the PSTAR values for Hydrogen at 1.25MeV based on the above equation. For a proton with incident energy of 1.25MeV 
      (from the Hah and Petrov article) and Hydrogen, PSTAR says that there is a total stopping power of \( 5.673 \times 10^{2}
      \frac{MeV cm^{2}}{g} \) and a CDSA of \( 1.253 \times 10^{-3} \frac{g}{cm^{2}} \). For the PSTAR with Oxygen at 1.25MeV, 
      we have the \( 1.858 \times 10^{2} \frac{MeV cm^{2}}{g} \) and a CDSA of \( 4.265 \times 10^{-3} \frac{g}{cm^{2}} \).

      Using the second equation from the Davis and Petrov article, we can use $$S_{D-D_{2}O}(E) = S_{D-O}(E)n_{O} + 
      S_{D-D}(E)n_{D}$$ Now I need to find the number density of deuterium and oxygen in the chamber, which I can find by 
      assuming that the pressure in the chamber is made up of non-interacting monatomic D&#8322;O vapor. $$ n_{D_{2}O} = n_{O}
      \mbox{ and } n_{D_{2}O} = \frac{1}{2}n_{D} $$ I will treat this as classical ideal gas even though we are working with a
      pressure of ~1 Torr. Using the ideal gas equation, we have $$ PV=Nk_{B}T $$ For the number density we can take \( 
      \frac{N}{V} \). Taking this from the ideal gas equation we will have $$ \frac{N}{V} = \frac{P}{k_{B}T} $$ I am going to 
      assume that T remains close to room temperature, I will approximate T~300K. This will give a close enough approximation. 
      1 Torr of pressure is around 133.3 Pa. Combining all of this we get: $$ n_{D_{2}O} = \frac{P}{k_{B}T} = \frac{133.3 Pa}
      {1.38 \times 10^{-23} \frac{J}{K} * 300K} = 3.22 \times 10^{22} \frac{\mbox{particles}}{m^{3}} = 
      3.22 \times 10^{16} \frac{\mbox{particles}}{cm^{3}} $$ In order to use the stopping power I found from NIST, I will 
      need the mass density of the particles instead of the number density. I believe that the Davis paper had a stopping 
      power different than ours, so number density worked for them. The number density of the oxygen is \( n_{O} = n_{D_{2}O} 
      =  3.22 \times 10^{16} \frac{\mbox{particles}}{cm^{3} \) and the number density of deuterium is \( n_{D} = 2n_{D_{2}O} 
      = 6.44 \times 10^{16} \) Converting these to mass density: $$ \rho = nm \mbox{ (for 1 particle in grams)} $$ The mass of 
      a each particle is 16 AMU or \( 2.66 \times 10^{-23} \)g for O and 2 AMU or \(3.32 \times 10^{-24} \)g for each D. The 
      mass densities are $$ \rho_{O} = 3.22 \times 10^{16} \frac{\mbox{particles}}{cm^{3} 2.66 \times 10^{-23} 
      \frac{g}{\mbox{particle}} = 8.57 \times 10^{-7} \frac{g}{cm^{3}} $$ and $$ \rho_{D} = 6.44 \times 10^{16} 
      \frac{\mbox{particles}}{cm^{3} 3.32 \times 10^{-24} \frac{g}{\mbox{particle}} = 2.14 \times 10^{-7} \frac{g}{cm^{3}} $$
