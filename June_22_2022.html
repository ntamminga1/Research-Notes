    <h3>Keeping tabs on what I've done recently:</h3>
    <p>I have soldered together the Teensy ethernet package and am currently working on setting up a SCPI communication style network between the 
      Teensy board and Labview as the client, running through the router. I am basing this off of the 
      <a href="https://github.com/Vrekrer/Vrekrer_scpi_parser">Vrekrer SCPI Parser</a> which sets up an SCPI ethernet communication system for Arduino 
      boards, specifically with the ENC28J60 chip. This is because the Vrekrer library calls the <a href="https://github.com/njh/EtherCard">EtherCard</a> 
      library which is specifically designed for the ENC28J60 chip, which the Teensy 4.1 boards don't have. I am trying to switch over the commands from 
      EtherCard to the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/ethernet/">Ethernet.h library</a> that works with our Teensy board.</p>
