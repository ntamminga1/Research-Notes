    <h3>3 Plasma Conditions</h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>\( \lambda_{D} << L \)</li>
      <li>\( N_{D} >> 1 \)</li>
      <li>\( \omega \tau > 1 \)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Section 1</h3>
    <p>Our universe is mostly made of plasma. However, we do not see this because of the Saha equation, which gives the amount of ionization to be 
      expected in a gas in thermal equilibrium: $$ \frac{n_{i}}{n_{n}} \approx 2.4 \times 10^{21} \frac{T^{3/2}}{n_{i}} e^{-U_{i}/k_{B}T} $$ Where 
      the variables are:
      <ul>
        <li>\(n_{i}\)  and \(n_{n}\) are the number density in m&#179; of the ionized and neutral atoms</li>
        <li>T is the temperature of the gas</li>
        <li>\(k_{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant</li>
        <li>\(U_{i}\) is the ionization energy of the gas (the energy to remove one electron from the outer shell)</li>
      </ul>
    The \(n_{i}\) on the RHS of the equation means that the ratio of ionized atoms to neutral atoms depends on the density of ionized atoms. This is 
    becuase the recombination rate of ionized atoms depends on how many ionized particles there are to recombine with. The average ratio of ionized 
    to neutral particles at room temperture is ~\(10^{-122}\).
    </p>
  
    <h3>Section 2</h3>
    <p><b>Plasma:</b> A quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibits collective behavior.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Collective Behavior:</b> Motions that depend not only on local conditions but on the state of the plasma in remote regions as well.
        This means that our ions and electrons are effected by the Coulomb force, which has a behavior of 1/r&#178;. This is the local behavior since
        it falls as r increases. However, if we take a solid angle of a plasma and increase r, the volume of plasma that will effect our particle
        will grow with r&#179;. This means that as we increase r, more plasma will effect the motion of our particle, leading to the
        effect of the remote behavior in our collective behavior.</li>
      <li><b>Quasineutral:</b> If the dimensions <i>L</i> of a system are much larger than \(\lambda_{D}\), then whenever lcoal concentrations of charge 
        arise or external potentials are introduced into the system, these are shielded out in a distance short compared with <i>L</i>. This leaves the 
        bulk of the plasma free of large electric potentials and fields.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Section 3</h3>
    <p>This section discusses the definition of temperature. Since, in a non-interacting ideal gas, we have \(E_{ave} = \frac{1}{2}k_{B}T\) per degree 
     of freedom, it is standard in plasma physics to just give values in units of energy. For example, in a 1eV plasma, we have \(k_{B}T=1eV=1.6 \times 
     10^{-19} J\). This ends up giving us a temperature of T=11,600 K, but we just refer to the plasma as a 1eV plasma instead of saying it's 11,600 
     degrees. High temperature does not necessarily mean lots of heat, the heat capacity of the material must be considered.</p>

    <h3>Section 4</h3>
    <p>Debye sheilding occurs when a charge source is placed in a plasma. If there is no thermal energy, the oppositely charged particles will be 
      attracted to the source and shield its electric field from the rest of the plasma. However, when there is thermal energy of the particles, the 
      particles on the outer most edge will be able to escape the electric field, allowing a small, finite electric field in the plasma. To find what 
      the electric potential looks like, we will use Poisson's equation. The text goes through this derviation in detail (see p. 9). We are left with 
      $$ \lambda_{D} \equiv (\frac{\epsilon_{o}k_{B}T_{e}}{ne^{2}})^{1/2} $$ 
    </p>

<h3>Section 5</h3>
<p>The number density of particles in a Debye sphere is $$ N_{D} = n \times \frac{4}{3} \pi \lambda_{D}^{3} $$ which is equal to \(1.38 \times 10^{6} 
  \frac{T^{3/2}}{n^{1/2}} \) where T is in Kelvin. Thus, collective behavior is defined as \(N_{D} >> 1\) as well as \( \lambda_{D} << L\).<\p>
  
  <h3>Section 6</h3>
  <p>The third plasma requirement deals with collisions. \(\omega\) is the frequency of a typical plasma oscillation and \(\tau\) is the mean time 
    between collisions. The requirement is that \(\omega \tau >1 \).<\p>
    
    <p>Section 7 discusses the applications of plasma physics, see this section pp. 13-17 for details</p>
