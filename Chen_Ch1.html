    <p>Summary</p>
    <p><b>Plasma:</b> A quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibits collective behavior.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Collective Behavior:</b> Motions that depend not only on local conditions but on the state of the plasma in remote regions as well.
        This means that our ions and electrons are effected by the Coulomb force, which has a behavior of 1/r&#178;. This is the local behavior since
        it falls as r increases. However, if we take a solid angle of a plasma and increase r, the volume of plasma that will effect our particle
        will grow with r&#179;. This means that as we increase r, more plasma will effect the motion of our particle, leading to the
        effect of the remote behavior in our collective behavior.</li>
      <li><b>Quasineutral:</b>
