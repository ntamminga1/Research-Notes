    <h1>Chapter 2: Single-Particle Motion</h1>
    <p>All fields in this chapter are perscribed and not effected by the motion of the particle.</p>
    
    <h3>Sections 1 and 2</h3>
    <p>When the E field is <b>E</b>=0, then the force on a charged particle (from the Lorentz force) is $$ m \frac{d<b>v</b>}{dt} = q<b>v</b> /times 
      <b>B</b> $$ If we take <b>B</b> to be in the z-direction, then we get a 2 differential equations: \( /ddot{v_{x}} = -/frac{qB}{m}^{2} v_{x} \) and
      \( /ddot{v_{y}} = -/frac{qB}{m}^{2} v_{y} \). We can define the constants to be the cyclotron frequency $$ \omega_{c} \equiv \frac{|q|B}{m} $$
      With the proper choice of phase, this yeilds the solution for the velocity \(v_{x} = v_{\bot} e^{i \omega_{c} t}\) and 
      \(v_{y} = \pm i v_{\bot} e^{i \omega_{c} t}\) where \(v_{\bot}\) is the velocity perpendicular to the B field and the sign is based on the charge. 
      If we calculate this for position with the proper initial conditions, we get \( x = -i \frac{v_{\bot}}{omega_{c}} e^{i \omega_{c} t}\) and 
      \( y = \pm \frac{v_{\bot}}{omega_{c}} e^{i \omega_{c} t}\). Thus, we can take the constants to be: $$ r_{L} \equiv \frac{v_{\bot}}{\omega_{c}} = 
      \frac{m v_{\bot}}{|q|B} $$ This value is called the Larmor radius. The real part of these equations describes the motion of the particle based 
      off a fixed guiding center. As we can see, the direction of the motion is charge dependent. Also, the shape in space is a helix.<\p>
