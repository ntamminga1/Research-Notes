    <h1>Week of June 27, 2022</h1>
    
    <h3>Monday, June 27</h3>
    <p>First I worked on wrapping up my Teensy 4.1 project. I did not get as far as I wanted, but I will definitely come back to it. Next, I wrote a short 
      python function for Scott which will display the Nucleo output as a line graph instead of a text output of the detectors value. Then, I worked on 
    installing a Proto Compiler and understanding what ProtoBuffers are.</p>
    
    <h3>Tuesday, June 28</h3>
    <p>I went down to the lab today. I was able to set up the ethernet connection into the chamber and run it to the lab network. The connection is solid 
    and I was able to ping my computer on the lab network. I flashed some firmware to the Nucleo board but the firmware died after 1s of running. Scott is 
    working on it.</p>
    
    <h3>Wednesday, June 29</h3>
    <p>Today I stayed in Columbus and continued to work through some protobuf issues.</p>
    
    <h3>Thursday, June 30</h3>
    <p>I went down to the lab today. First, I finally fixed all my protobuf issues and was able to run an example software. Then, Scott was able to flash 
    a new Nucleo code and we verified that the boards can be pinged by the lab network. However, the connection was spotty and Scott is working to fix it. 
    I also was able to set up a static IP address for my computer. The next step will be to wire in the board to a trigger box and see if the box will 
      light up 2 times a second with the box running at a kHz rate since board skips every 499 imputs for 1 output.</p>
    
    <h3>Friday, July 1</h3>
