    <h3>Notes on the Davis and Petrov article:</h3>
    <p><i>Angular distribution of neutrons from high-intensity laserâ€“target interactions</i> by J Davis and G M Petrov</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper mentions that they have a stopping power equation S(E\( _{i} \)). I believe that they are computing
      these values as follows. $$ S_{D-X}(E) = S_{H-X}(\frac{E}{2}) $$ X is the material that our deuterons or hydrogen
        are interacing with. We can calculate the interactions with carbon and deuterium
      based on the NIST STAR programs and the technique above. The paper combines the C and D energies as follows $$ S_{D-CD_{2}}
      (E) = S_{D-C}(E)n_{C} + S_{D-D}(E)n_{D} $$ where \( n_{C} \) and \( n_{D} \) are the target (or catcher) number densities
      of each particle. I can use this to help calculate the stopping distance of the 
        <a href="https://ntamminga1.github.io/Research-Notes/May_13_2022.html">deuterons in heavy water vapor</a>.</li>
      <li>Figure 5 of this paper shows a cross section for neutron production v. deuteron energy graph. This peaks with a 
      cross section of \( 10^{-29} m^{2} \) at a deuteron energy of ~2.5-3 MeV.</li>
      <li>The angular distribution of neutrons depends most on the peak laser intensity and laser pulse duration. The 
        simulation was able to put \( ~10^{4} \) neutrons on a target ~10m away.
    </ul>
   
    <h3>Notes on the Hah and Petrov article:</h3>
    <p><i>High repetition-rate neutron generation by several-mJ, 35 fs pulses interacting with free- flowing D&#8322;O</i> by
      J. Hah, G. M. Petrov, J. A. Nees, et al.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This experiment is performed on the Lambda-cubed laser facility at Michigan.</li>
      <li>The laser specs are a 1/2kHz rep rate with a peak intensity of \( >10^{19} \) W/cm&#178; and a pulse energy of 6-12mJ. 
        It is a Ti:sapphire laser (\( \lambda \)=800nm) with a pulse duration of 35fs. It produced 2.45MeV neutrons.</li>
      <li>The capliary is 10 microns and the chamber is at a pressure of 20 Torr.</li>
