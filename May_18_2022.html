    <p>Notes on the Davis and Petrov article:</p>
    <p><i>Angular distribution of neutrons from high-intensity laserâ€“target interactions</i> by J Davis and G M Petrov</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper mentions that they have a stopping power equation S(E\( _{i} \)). I believe that they are computing
      these values as follows. $$ S_{D}(E) = S_{H}(\frac{E}{2}) $$ We can calculate the interactions with carbon and deuterium
      based on the NIST STAR programs and the technique above. The paper combines the C and D energies as follows $$ S_{D-CD_{2}}
      (E) = S_{D-C}(E)n_{C} + S_{D-D}(E)n_{D} $$ where \( n_{C} \) and \( n_{D} \) are the target (or catcher) number densities
      of each particle. I can use this to help calculate the stopping distance of the 
        <a href="https://ntamminga1.github.io/Research-Notes/May_13_2022.html">deuterons in heavy water vapor</a>.</li>
      <li>Figure 5 of this paper shows a cross section for neutron production v. deuteron energy graph. This peaks with a 
      cross section of \( 10^{-29} m^{2} \) at a deuteron energy of ~2.5-3 MeV.</li>
      <li>The angular distribution of neutrons depends most on the peak laser intensity and laser pulse duration. The 
        simulation was able to put \( ~10^{4} \) neutrons on a target ~10m away.
